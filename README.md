# repo-name

`Project name` built as part of <a href="">The Odin Project curriculum</a>.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm i && npm i -D concurrently@8.2.2`
- Start server: `npm start`

**Note**: `npm start` starts the development server and watches for changes, automatically bundling the source files to the `./dist` folder. If you only want to build the project without starting the development server, use `npm run build`.
